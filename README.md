  â™” Chess Analysis
</h1>

## Overview

This script allows one to analyze their most recent `chess.com` game in the style of chess.com's own _Game Review_. Free users get one _Game Review_ per day and I thought I could create my own since the chess engine chess.com uses, `Stockfish`, is open source and has a decent python library.

### Setup

1. Install the necessary Python modules by running `pip install req.txt`
2. Enter your username in `details.py`
3. Run `game_review.py` and begin learning

### Things to improve

- Implement a GUI system
